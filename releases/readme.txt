For historical reasons, some versions of the extension have been packaged twice:
- once as bundled within eZP
- once as independent traball available on projects.ez.no for download

While those two versions are identical in functionality, they differ in checksums.

Hence the need to clarify a little bit what is available here:

2.1.0: copy of the version bundled with eZP 4.4
2.0.4: only a "community" release
2.0.3: copy of the community release (even though it was also bundled with eZP 4.3)
2.0.2: copy of the community release (even though it was also bundled with eZP 4.2)
2.0.1: copy of the community release
2.0.0: copy of the community release

PLEASE do not recreate extension/ezoracle subdiretory for every tagged release,
just a dir containing directly the extension's contents
