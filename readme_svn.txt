The structure of the repository is slightly different from the one used by other eZ Systems projects:

- releases: full copies of released versions - in eZ standard it is normally 'versions'
- branches: one branch for every major version of the extension - in eZ standard it is 'stable'
- trunk: where most of the development happens, will turn into next major version
