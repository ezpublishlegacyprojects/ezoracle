Changes from 1.8.2 to 1.8.3 - released 2010/yy/zz

*General:
- Added update sql scripts up to 4.0.7
- vastly improved the consistency checks and the generated corrective sql in the "Setup"/"System upgrade check" page
  To take full advantage of the improvements, you should use eZ Publish 4.0.8+
  For lower versions in the 4.0 series a patched kernel/setup/systemupgrade.php script
  is available in the 'patches' directory of the extension.
- new parameters are possible to improve performance of the index_image_oracle.php
  script in cluster setups. More details in the README.cluster file
