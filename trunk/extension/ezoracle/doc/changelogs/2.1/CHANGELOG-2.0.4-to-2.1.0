Changes from 2.0.4 to 2.1.0 - released 2010/xx/yy

*General:
- removed the "patches" directory, as no patches are currently needed to eZPublish 4.4 kernel code
- moved the command line scripts from extension/ezoracle/scripts to the more standard ones:
  extension/ezoracle/bin/php
  extension/ezoracle/bin/shell
- removed the deprecated script ora-drop-schema.sh. Use ora-drop-schema.php instead

*Bugfixes:
