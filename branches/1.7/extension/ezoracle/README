Requirements
============

The following requirements exists for using eZ Oracle extension:

o  eZ Publish version:

   Make sure you eZ Publish version [EXTENSION_PUBLISH_VERSION] or higher  (3.10.x), earlier
   versions did not take Oracle properly into account and will not work
   correctly.

o  Oracle version:

   Make sure you have Oracle 8 or higher (client and server).
   Please note that the Oci8 page on the PHP manual at www.php.net states
   that only Oracle version 9 and higher is supported for the client side.

   The Oracle "Easy Connect Naming Method" is not supported at this time to
   specify the database server to connect to.

   If the Oracle server version is less than 9.2, setting the environment
   variable NLS_LANG is mandatory to indicate that php expects to receive
   data from the database in the character set specified in the
   [DatabaseSettings]-Charset setting in the site.ini configuration file.

o  PHP with Oracle support:

   Make sure your PHP installation has compiled in support for Oracle. To
   compile this you will need the Oracle client libraries and headers.
   The standard windows version of php includes the dll needed for oracle support.

o  Oracle user with correct permissions:

   Make sure you have a user on the oracle server that can create the
   following elements: session, table, trigger, sequence and procedure.
